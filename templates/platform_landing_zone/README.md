# Azure Landing Zones Accelerator Starter Module for Terraform - Azure Verified Modules Complete Multi-Region

This module is part of the Azure Landing Zones Accelerator solution. It is a complete multi-region implementation of the Azure Landing Zones Platform Landing Zone for Terraform.

It deploys a hub and spoke virtual network or Virtual WAN architecture across multiple regions.

The module deploys the following resources:

- Management group hierarchy
- Azure Policy definitions and assignments
- Role definitions
- Management resources, including Log Analytics workspace and Automation account
- Hub and spoke virtual network or Virtual WAN architecture across multiple regions
- DDOS protection plan
- Private DNS zones

## Usage

The module is intended to be used with the [Azure Landing Zones Accelerator](https://aka.ms/alz/acc). Head over there to get started.

>NOTE: The module can be used independently if needed. Example `tfvars` files can be found in the `examples` directory for that use case.

### Running Directly

#### Run the local examples

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root of the module directory with the following content, replacing the placeholders with the actual values:

```hcl
starter_locations            = ["uksouth", "ukwest"]
subscription_id_connectivity = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
subscription_id_identity     = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
subscription_id_management   = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

##### Hub and Spoke Virtual Networks Multi Region

```powershell
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file ./examples/full-multi-region/hub-and-spoke-vnet.tfvars
```

##### Virtual WAN Multi Region

```powershell
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file ./examples/full-multi-region/virtual-wan.tfvars
```
